**Testing Guidelines**

* **Test Structure**:
  - Use `act` for state updates and `waitFor` for verifications
  - Group related assertions in a single `waitFor`
  - Order assertions from most specific to most general
  - Add clear comments explaining the purpose of each verification step

* **DOM Queries**:
  - Be specific with selectors to avoid false positives
  - Scope queries to specific containers when possible
  - Prefer `getByTestId` over generic selectors
  - Check the actual HTML rendered in test errors

* **Environment Safety**:
  - Never modify `process.env` directly in tests
  - Use `jest.spyOn(process.env, 'VARIABLE_NAME', 'get')` to mock environment variables
  - Restore all spies and mocks in `afterEach` blocks
  - Design tests to work correctly when run in parallel

* **Type Safety in Tests**:
  - Prefer specific types over `any` when possible
  - Use `unknown` instead of `any` for better type safety
  - Implement type guards for runtime type checking
  - Define clear interfaces for test data structures
  - Document type expectations in test comments
  - Handle type errors with descriptive messages

* **Test Code Formatting**:
  - Follow Prettier rules for test files
  - Keep test descriptions clear and concise
  - Use consistent indentation for test blocks
  - Format long conditions across multiple lines when required
  - Maintain consistent spacing around operators

* **Test Coverage**:
  - Maintain 90%+ test coverage for all new code
  - Focus on testing behavior, not implementation details
  - Test edge cases and error scenarios
  - Verify component behavior before writing tests

* **Redux Testing Best Practices**:
  - Use type-safe action creators in tests
  - Mock Redux store with proper typing
  - Test both success and failure scenarios
  - Verify action types and payloads
  - Test middleware behavior with proper type checking
  - Use type guards for thunk testing
  - Disable serialization checks in tests when needed (`serializableCheck: false`)
  - Use specific selectors instead of returning full state
  - Configure store with proper middleware and extra arguments
  - Clean state between tests
  - Mock external dependencies through `extraArgument`

* **Error Handling in Tests**:
  - Test error scenarios explicitly
  - Verify error messages and types
  - Handle async errors properly
  - Test error boundaries when applicable
  - Document expected error behavior

* **Hook Testing Best Practices**:
  - Create custom wrapper for hook tests
  - Configure Redux Provider correctly
  - Handle async operations with `act`
  - Clean up between tests
  - Mock external dependencies
  - Test all hook states (loading, error, success)
  - Verify state transitions
  - Test edge cases and error scenarios

* **Test Environment Safety**:
  - Never modify `process.env` directly in tests
  - Use `jest.spyOn` for environment variable mocking
  - Ensure test isolation by restoring all spies and mocks
  - Design tests to work correctly in parallel execution
  - Clean up environment modifications to prevent test pollution

* **Test Configuration**:
  - Configure ALL mocks BEFORE importing the module to test
  - Use `jest.isolateModules()` to prevent test pollution
  - Clean mocks and state in `beforeEach`
  - Restore mocks and spies in `afterEach/afterAll`
  - Document test purpose with clear comments
  - Verify environment variables are correctly mocked
  - Use `expect.any()` for dynamic values instead of hardcoding

* **State Management**:
  - Clean state between tests
  - Restore original environment variables
  - Verify mocks don't affect other tests
  - Use `beforeEach` for setup and `afterEach` for cleanup
  - Document test dependencies
  - Avoid shared state between tests
  - Verify state is properly restored

* **Test Documentation**:
  - Explain each test's purpose
  - Document non-obvious test cases
  - Explain mock configuration
  - Document state management
  - Explain expectations
  - Document debugging process
  - Keep documentation updated
